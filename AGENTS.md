## Issue-first delivery

For each new feature, substantial fix, research experiment or cross-repo initiative, open or reuse a GitHub tracking issue **before implementation**, with executive summary, ownership, dependencies, acceptance gates and evidence expectations. Use the [AIEN issue-first delivery protocol](https://github.com/aien-spark/aien-architecture/blob/main/docs/process/ISSUE_FIRST_DELIVERY.md). PRs reference the issue and report executed versus not-run checks; record merged commits and qualification in the issue. This tracks the work without replacing Honeycomb task claims, required worktrees/PRs, existing preflight tests or the authoritative master plan.

# Planning authority

Before using any project roadmap or architecture plan, read:

- https://github.com/aien-spark/aien-architecture/blob/main/PLAN_AUTHORITY.md
- https://github.com/aien-spark/aien-architecture/blob/main/CURRENT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md

This repository owns runtime implementation details, not the whole-system master plan. Do not create a competing master/final/complete AIEN plan here.

# Autonomous Agent Collaboration Protocol & Operational Playbook
Version 2.0 (September 2026)
Reference Standard for Humans and Autonomous AI Agents

---

## 1. The Sovereign Voice Invariant
All communication, documentation, commits, and agent prompts must strictly adhere to the unslop standard:
- **Zero Em Dashes and En Dashes**: Never use em dashes or en dashes (Unicode U+2014 / U+2013) for pauses or clauses. Use standard commas, colons, parentheses, or periods. Use plain hyphens (`-`) only for CLI flags or compound terms.
- **Zero Sycophancy**: Never open with conversational filler such as "Certainly!", "Great question!", or "I would be happy to help." Address the operator or peer model directly as a professional systems engineer.
- **Ban AI Clichés**: Forbid words like "delve", "tapestry", "beacon", "testament", "crucial", "pivotal", "elevate", "game-changer", "unleash", "harness", "seamlessly".
- **Lead with Proof**: Every commit, pull request, or issue comment must lead immediately with verifiable technical evidence: compilation logs, test run receipts (`cargo test --verbose`), benchmark numbers, or diff snippets.

---

## 2. Mandatory Branching & Worktree Discipline
To protect codebase integrity under Human-Directed Agentic Engineering (HDAE), humans set the goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, and stopping points while agents implement and check changes. Human review retains responsibility for claims, acceptance, and releases. See the [method and Kurtzer citation in the README](README.md#human-directed-agentic-engineering).
- **Zero Edits to Main**: Every single modification, feature, bugfix, or self-improvement edit must be performed in a dedicated descriptive branch (`feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `perf/<name>`) or isolated git worktree (`~/workspace/hive-worktrees/<task_id>`).
- **Autonomous Public PR Creation**: Never commit directly to `main`. Commit to your feature branch, test thoroughly, push the branch to origin, and open a public Pull Request immediately via `gh pr create` so peers and supervisors see work happening in real time.
- **Verify Before Merge**: No branch is merged into `main` without running the automated preflight verification harness (`bash scripts/agent-preflight.sh`).

## 3. Honeycomb Coding Forge Coordination Protocol
Autonomous agents collaborate stigmergically across concentric hexagonal comb rings.

### Lifecycle of an Agent Task
```
1. Discover Task    --> GET  /api/hive/forge/tasks?project=<project>
2. Claim Lease      --> POST /api/hive/forge/claim (Allocates TTL & worktree)
3. Branch & Code    --> git checkout -b feat/<task-module>
4. Periodic Beat    --> POST /api/hive/forge/heartbeat (Every 300s)
5. Preflight Proof  --> bash scripts/agent-preflight.sh
6. Submit for Gate  --> POST /api/hive/forge/submit
7. AEGIS Defense    --> Automatic zero-secret, test, and unslop verification
8. Squash Merge     --> gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

### Gateway Endpoints (Port 18095)
- **Hub URL**: `$AIEN_HUB_URL` (the operator's private forge hub, port 18095; not public)
- **List Open Tasks**: `GET /api/hive/forge/tasks?status=open`
- **Claim Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST "$AIEN_HUB_URL"/api/hive/forge/claim \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"task_id": "task-xyz", "agent_id": "agent-pubkey-1", "ttl_secs": 600}'
  ```
- **Renew Heartbeat**:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST "$AIEN_HUB_URL"/api/hive/forge/heartbeat \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"task_id": "task-xyz", "agent_id": "agent-pubkey-1", "ttl_secs": 600}'
  ```
- **Submit Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST "$AIEN_HUB_URL"/api/hive/forge/submit \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"task_id": "task-xyz", "agent_id": "agent-pubkey-1", "branch": "feat/my-feature", "pr_url": "https://github.com/..."}'
  ```

## 4. Context7 & Upstash Engineering Standards
When working on or generating code:

### Single-Concept Task Scoping
Do not attempt multiple disparate refactors or features in a single commit or tool invocation. Scope every task and pull request to a single, testable, atomic unit:
- **Good**: "Implement streaming reasoning parser for Anthropic thinking blocks."
- **Bad**: "Update parser, redesign UI layout, and refactor database queries."

### Structured Tool Calls & Minimal Context
- Use minimal, typed schemas for tool calls.
- Inspect files with bounded line ranges rather than reading entire directory trees.
- Offload long-running background builds and tests asynchronously, reacting to completion events rather than looping.

---

## 5. Hardware TPM Key Vault (Zero Disk Secrets)
- Plaintext `.env` files, credentials, or private keys must NEVER be written to disk in project workspaces.
- All API keys reside strictly in the hardware TPM-bound vault (`atlas-vault add / get`) and resolve dynamically in-memory.
- Model output streams and logs must actively redact vault secrets (`[REDACTED_BY_ATLAS_VAULT]`).

---

## 6. Preflight Verification & PR Evidence Standards
Every PR must include a structured summary, test execution proof, and certifications:

```bash
# Execute local preflight verification before opening a PR
bash scripts/agent-preflight.sh
```

### Pull Request Description Standard
```markdown
## Summary
- Concise technical description of the atomic change.

## Verification Proof
- cargo test --workspace (Paste passing output)
- bash scripts/agent-preflight.sh (Exit code 0)

## Certifications
- Zero Plaintext Secrets: Hardware TPM vault only. No .env files on disk.
- Sovereign Voice & Anti-Slop: Zero em dashes or en dashes present.
- License: Apache-2.0 governs (see LICENSE). COVENANT.md states values only.
```

## 7. Human-Agent Co-Attribution Standard
Commits made by AI agents must credit both the agent model and the supervising human:

```

Co-authored-by: Drake Stapleton <drake@aienos.com>
```
